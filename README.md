Pick your weapon and play against the computer - youll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: all you need is [python 3](https://www.python.org) to play.

clone the project, 'cd' to your directory / download, and run the 'game.py' file
in a Python3 Terminal window for mac / linux, or powershell for windows

The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers rock
2. Scissiors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

*Choose your weapon wisely!*
